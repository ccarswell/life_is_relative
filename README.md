# Life Is Relative - CK3 Mod
Life Is Relative mod for CK3


If we can find out what the current skill level is, 
then we can replace the text in the Character window with a value.  
Trying to figure out how to make a custom variable somewhere and retrieve it into the value

We wouldn't want to overwrite the value itself, just overwrite the label in the character window


NOTES:
Don't use global variables i think. Or events
Can use localisation for my values in the skill numbers
